# ft_printf

## Description
The `ft_printf` project is a reimplementation of the standard C `printf` function.  
The goal of this project is to understand and implement a function capable of formatted output, handling different types of data such as integers, strings, characters, and hexadecimal numbers.  
The project focuses on developing skills in C, understanding variadic functions, and managing formatted output while respecting the behavior of the original `printf`.  

## Instructions
### Compilation
To compile your `ft_printf` implementation, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -c ft_printf.c
ar rcs libftprintf.a ft_printf.o
